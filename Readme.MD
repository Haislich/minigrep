# Minigrep
This is a guided project taken from [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch12-00-an-io-project.html).
The main concerns of the project are:
- Take familiarity with various kind of output:
    - Standard output
    - Standard error
- Understanding how to handle Errors gracfully without the overhead of causing useless panics
- Using lifetimes 
- Structure a project, dividing the main and the lib components
